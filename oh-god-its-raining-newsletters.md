# Oh God, It's Raining Newsletters

> Email’s beginning was perfectly unremarkable: “QWERTYUIOP.” A keyboard burp. Something your cat might type. A nothing message sent by Ray Tomlinson in 1971 to test the system. But email has stayed, and has largely stayed decentralized, and from that — its ubiquity and lack of central authority — email has become one of the most boringly powerful publishing platforms around.

> Email is definitely not ideal, but it is: decentralized, reliable, and not going anywhere – and more and more, those feel like quasi-magical properties. (quoted from Robin Sloan)

Social networks are just not a good distribution platform (anymore?). Facebook is Facebook, Twitter has restrained demographics, Instagram... 👇

> Instagram will only get more complex, less knowable, more algorithmic, more engagement-hungry in 2019.

> _I don’t bring any of this up with malice. This is the contract we enter into in using “free” venture backed social networks. They have to achieve scale and maximize profitability, often (paradoxically) at the expense of usability. Frogs boiling in water and all that._

> I try to be deliberate, and social networks seem more and more to say: You don’t know what you want, but we do.

> I think we’ve inured ourselves to the (false) truth that in order to post something, in order to contribute something to the stream, we must look at the stream itself, “Bird Box”-esque, and woe be the person in a productive creative jag, wanting to publish, who can resist those hot political tweets.

Very good observation - you don't have to be in your inbox to send an email, you have to be on Twitter to send a tweet. Distractions

Why newsletters? Intimacy.

> This intimacy — both from my side and that of the recipients — seems to engender a kind of vulnerability that I haven’t found elsewhere online. But the intimacy is not surprising: the conversation is one-to-one even though the distribution is one-to-many.

> And the epistolary nature of email helps reinforce our shared humanity — the one-to-oneness — we so often lose on social networks.

(as footnote 👇)

> And so much better than just publishing on my website. Newsletter subscriptions are the push that RSS promised but never became. And CMD-R to reply is the best, most intuitive commenting system I’ve yet seen.

Archival of newsletters is complex, but maybe this is also a factor for their intimacy, authenticity. At the same time they're also very durable, backed up in millions of private inboxes.

> A lot of this newsletter writing is happening, probably, because the archives aren’t great. Tenuousness unlocks the mind, loosens tone. But the archival reality might be just the opposite of that common perception: These newsletters are the most backed up pieces of writing in history, copies in millions of inboxes, on millions of hard drives and servers, far more than any blog post.
