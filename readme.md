Thought of the moment:

> If you’re having trouble figuring out what to write about, Donnelly suggests making note of topics that stir up a strong reaction in your personal and professional life. “Reacting to things is a good way to get you started. So if you are reading something and it gives you a reaction, pause and think about what that reaction is about, and if it's because you disagree with their approach. If you do, what was the approach that you would do instead? There’s your topic.” ([source](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Build-a-Media-Company-Around-Your-Niche-with-Jacob-Donnelly-db011f7ce0cd4408a32b6aa941e82b3f))
