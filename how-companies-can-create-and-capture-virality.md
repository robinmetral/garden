# How Companies Can Create and Capture Virality

- seize the moment (react quickly on anything going viral). ex: ocean spray on TikTok
- create scarcity (lower supply = higher demand. When goods are scarcer, they become more sought-after). ex: Supreme streetwear brand
- break the mold (do things differently). ex: startup MSCHF ships unconventional products, like "finger on the app", the person keeping their finger on the app the longest wins 25k
- let creators control the narrative (campaigns are more successful nowadays when influencers are not just paid to endorse a product, but hired to make a campaign). ex: dobrik and Chipotle
- tailor to the channel (self-expl.). ex: burger king "some things from 2010 are worth revisiting, like your old tweets and funnel cake fries"
