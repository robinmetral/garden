# Into the Personal Website Verse

About social media:

> What started out as the most promising development in the history of the Web – the participation of users in the creation of content and online dialogue at scale – has turned into a swamp of sensation, lies, hate speech, harassment, and noise.

Concrete downsides of social media:

- algorithms optimize for engagement = loud and outrageous is amplified
- difficult for new voices to be heard on platforms like Medium or Twitter
- platforms can be shut down
- data ownership issues
- owning content is particularly important as a creator, part of your identity

Alternative: the personal website

- write, create, share anything
- unlimited shots on the web: creation is free
- space for experimenting, trying new tech, formats, etc. (limited by platforms)

Ideal: decentralized web. Interconnected personal websites publishing own content and engaging in discussion

At the moment most of the discussion takes place on social media but this is a choice. It could be different

How to strengthen connection between personal websites?

- quote people, link to other sites, bring back the webring
- use RSS
- use website directories (by industry/theme, like the IndieWeb directory)
- use webmentions, microformats, join the indieweb
- go to conferences like the homebrew website club

> “Don’t do it like me. Do it like you.”
