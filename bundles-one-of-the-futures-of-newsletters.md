# Bundles, one of the futures of newsletters

"Bundles"... ðŸ‘‡

> As in bundling together a few newsletters under one price, to feed off each othersâ€™ reach and prepare for the much feared newsletter fatigue. Various people in the space are already subscribed to multiple paying newsletters and are worried that readers will get tired of this multiplication and that said multiplication will hurt everyone, making it harder to grow a sustainable income or business.

### On fatigue

Newsletter fatigue = the idea that there are too many subscription newsletters, and it's getting more difficult to generate income from this model

> to insiders it looks like fatigue but really, if you take all the top newsletters, itâ€™s still a tiny tiny fraction of potential readers, we are nowhere near mass market or late adopters

Newsletters have been around for a long time (2010 and TinyLetter), what's new is the tech driven subscription model

-> fatigue is probably not a real risk

### Bundling at large

Bundling and unbundling is a great "disruption" theory of the Silicon Valley.

**Unbundling**: separate the valuable part of a business from the rest of the business and monetize it

- > Airbnb unbundled hotel rooms from the hotel building and service
- > Uber unbundled drivers from the taxi company
- (note: SumUp is unbundling card payments from banks, now rebundling by becoming a bank and more)
- > Podcasts unbundled radio, now Spotify is rebundling them

Related: **Aggregation**.

> Airbnb aggregates rooms and renters, Uber aggregates drivers and riders, Facebook aggregates advertisers and eyeballs, Amazon aggregates consumers and brands, Spotify aggregates listeners, etc.

Summing up:

> legacy businesses bundled some infrastructure and a number of components to make various services and products possible. Tech companies often unbundle the core of the product or service from the legacy infrastructure but aggregate supply and demand through a much thinner, more scalableâ€”some would argue more extractiveâ€”layer of software

## Content bundles

> The analog to newsletter bundles is of course the newspaper or magazine.

> They are interesting for the curation of what goes in, for the local relevance, or simply because it is (mostly was) the best way to get the things you are interested in and the rest just comes along.

## Newsletter bundles

Patrick jumps into numbers.

Ex: Everything groups 5 newsletters and goes for 20/mo, 4x the standard subscription newsletter.

> Purely by the numbers, great deal. If you are interested in all of them.

> How many newsletters on an adjacent topic do you want to pay for? Is it really easier to pay $20 for five-six good titles that fit together but which you donâ€™t select? Or $20 for four you do select? Sure, they might grow to ten titles, which might make it an easy decision but then, are they really all pulling their weight and is the group really scaling so much more that a tenth of the revenue makes more sense than going at it alone? If it doesnâ€™t, how much are the writers with the smallest audience paid? Is it really a bundle or more of a newspaper with ten columns led by a headliner?

> All of this to say that thereâ€™s probably only a thin sliver of market opportunities for a few writers to get together under one price umbrella. Too diverse and people will subscribe piecemeal (if they can, otherwise to competitors), too numerous and you need to charge too much, or have wildly varied readerships, or grow too big to make sense as just a bunch of emails.

## Variations

1.

Bundling writers instead of newsletters, i.e. a group of writers author a single email. Ex: https://nothing.substack.com/

2.

> Pay Dumbcities $5/50 directly or pay $20/200 to get Dumbcities and four other newslettersâ€™ membersâ€™ issues. (Yes, similar to Everything but keeping each publication standalone while also adding a bundled price would be key here.)

## Wrapping up

> In the end, my reckon so far is that since thereâ€™s no physical or logistical reasons to wrap things together, a bundle must make a lot of sense content, deal, and revenue wise. All other combinations either fail or represent the first steps in becoming a more common publication.
