# The Analog City and the Digital City

> We are caught between two ages, as it were, and we are experiencing all of the attendant confusion, frustration, and exhaustion that such a liminal state involves. To borrow a line from the Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci, “The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.”

We might think that there are problems with digital platforms like social media, and we could fix it by for example regulating more. But actually a more fundamental change is going on, we are between two eras.

> As Neil Postman once put it, “In the year 1500, fifty years after the printing press was invented, we did not have old Europe plus the printing press. We had a different Europe.” So, likewise, we may say that in the year 2020, fifty years after the Internet was invented, we do not have old America plus the Internet. We have a different America.

## The Two Cities

The problem is that we have two "cities" coexisting at the moment, analog and digital. The digital city has emerged and is growing rapidly. We cannot reconcile the two.

From: St Augustine, City of God vs City of Man. Important: it's actually a shared public space (single city) but inhabitants, depending on whether they're in the city of god or of man, have a radically different view of reality, morality, the civil society.

Similar in the digital vs analog cities. Example: fact-checking.

- Analog city: information scarcity, easy to convince people of what the truth is
- Digital city: information abundance, possible to find facts to back _anything_

> The anodyne insistence on fact-checking to bridge chasms in worldview misunderstands the nature of our new media environment; it fails to see the difference between the economics of information scarcity and the economics of information abundance. Information scarcity may lend itself to a measure of credulity: When facts are few, persuading the ignorant is relatively easy. But information abundance, already characteristic of early modern societies, engenders a degree of skepticism: The more there is to know, the more likely we feel that truth is elusive. Information super-abundance, or the condition of “digital plenitude,” as media scholar Jay David Bolter has called it, encourages the view that truth isn’t real: Whatever view you want to validate, you’ll find facts to support it. All information is also now potentially disinformation. Fact-checking, however well-intentioned, does not solve the problem; paradoxically, it may in some cases make it worse. It is an Analog City solution insufficient to the problems of the Digital City.

Reminds me of Russ Roberts: "The Universe is full of dots. Connect the right ones and you can draw anything. The important question is not whether the dots you picked are really there, but why you chose to ignore all the others." (How Adam Smith Can Change your Life)

## The World Reanimated

A brief history of media revolutions:

> The consequences of writing disseminated gradually, as writing was, for much of its history, a practice limited to a few. Beginning in the sixteenth century, printing accelerated and distributed the effects of the written word, playing a critical role in the emergence of the modern world — famously in the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century with the telegraph, electronic media began to reshape the order built on the foundation of print, a reordering that grew more pronounced with the appearance of radio and television. For the first time in history, a dispersed mass audience could be reached simultaneously, helping to produce a culture in which slow reflection on the printed word gave way to instantaneous reaction on a mass scale. Then digital media appeared on the scene, intensifying this transformation while at the same time reviving the volatility and drama of two-way, instant communication.

> As Neil Postman puts it:
>
> > New technologies alter the structure of our interests: the things we think about. They alter the character of our symbols: the things we think with. And they alter the nature of community: the arena in which thoughts develop.

- _about_: attention. Ex: TV directs attention to physical features, unlike radio. Social media algorithms direct our attention
- _with_: medium. Not the same to think with a book, a tweet, or a meme. Ex. the TV made it possible to convey thoughts without words, which is both _more_ than the written word (different emotional register) and _less_ (more shallow argument)
- _arena_: audience. Long form thoughts below >

The self is defined in relation to the Other (philosophy). We yearn for acceptance and change our behavior to fit expectations by the audience.

Social media used this idea when designing reward mechanisms (likes, retweets). Shaping our identities.

(off topic? but interesting >)

> Online venues, whether social media platforms, messaging apps, or forums, are not simply places we go to express our political opinions; they are places where our political habits and sensibilities are formed.

It also changed how we speak, matching content moderation policies, format (250 characters?), reward systems etc. Thought to self: reward mechanisms promote more "aggressive" content, certainty, one-sidedness, radical thought. No space for nuance, doubt, uncertainty.

Another difference between the analog and digital cities, about free speech:

- In the analog city (print culture), writing was a slow process. It took time to form thought, anyone trained to think eventually corrected themselves during the writing process. Eventually false thoughts were silenced in the marketplace of idea, truth triumphed
- In the digital city, writing is done and shared without a lot of thought, response is immediate. The marketplace of ideas is dead. Now algorithms show certain ideas to certain people and create idea bubbles

## Shattered Myths

### The Reenchanted Self

Ideas by Charles Taylor (https://tif.ssrc.org/2008/09/02/buffered-and-porous-selves/)

- Enchanted world: things outside of the self have meaning and influence on the self (ex: spirits, cosmic forces). The self is vulnerable, seeks refuge and protection in a well-ordered society. Heresy can endanger the entire community and bring about uncontrollable consequences by external agents.
- Disenchanted world: only the human mind has meaning. The self is self-possessed, independent, autonomous.

The disenchanted world is the modern analog city. In the digital city, we see features of the enchanted world coming back. External agents (ex: algorithms) can influence the self, it seeks refuge in communities and strives for their purity

### The Perpetual Now

> As embodied creatures, our experience is structured by time and place

We identify to the communities we share time and space with. Modern analog city: geographical lines above family/tribal ancestry: the nation-state. Shared stories, memories.

Digital city: demise of shared space and triumph of shared time. Trend already present with ex. TV (shared time for audience, shared space in front of the TV). Less loyalty to local communities or nation-state,

- Oral societies: knowledge is fleeting. Conservative societies, lots of importance on sharing stories and keeping the past alive. Look back on the past
- Advent of writing: no longer rely on spoken work. Can turn to the future. Utopian, think the best is to come (but writing is still for a small minority)
- Democratization of writing: the self can own personal memories, societies become more individualistic
- Modern digital world: paradox, we can document our selves more than ever but don't know how to deal with all these archived memories. Stuck in permanent present

> We have never been able to document our lives so thoroughly as we now can with the help of digital tools, yet we feel that time is out of joint and that we’ve lost the thread of both our personal and collective histories. We appear to be both obsessive documenters of our experience, yet largely indifferent to or overwhelmed by the archives we create. We have ever more access to the past, but we are unable to bring it meaningfully to bear on the present.

cf. Plato's critique of writing: it relieves individuals of the burden of sustaining memories

> Although digital media appears to sustain memory, it is more like oral communication in its evanescence. The feed of our tweets and status updates recedes not as quickly and decisively as the spoken word, but with a similar effect.

### The View from Everywhere

In the digital city neutrality, consensus are dead. The institutions supporting it (gov, science, the market...) are not trusted anymore. We see a multitude of isolated niches that, if they come in contact, cannot find common ground to stand on.

> Our trouble believing in neutrality is in part because of the new arrangement of social relations through digital media, which sustains the proliferation of niche identities and brings these into volatile proximity with one another. This new social order is hyper-pluralistic, a place of ceaseless and irresolvable conflict. Our identities take shape as we self-select into ever more narrow subcultures, and we are then drawn together in public forums lacking a sense of a greater whole to which we might all belong.

## The Self Does Not Compute

Work of art: idea of an "aura" for the original, it's unique even if reproduced. For example I can tear a reproduction of a Rembrandt, not an original.

Similar in the digital city. Digital selves are not the original. This causes us to think that:

- they don't have the same moral value (ex: shaming digital others is more okay then physical others)
- they're not authentic, are artificial constructs. Social media identities are no real identities. Doubt the good faith of others
