# Frameworks Can Be Limiting

#ToCreate

Going from a passive to an active stance is hard because we are wired to dislike change, we're scared to show ourselves to the world, and more.

Resources on how to do anything are abundant, and they're an easy way to procrastinate getting started on something.

They're particularly dangerous because they _feel_ productive. We think that we are making progress on our project, but we're not.
