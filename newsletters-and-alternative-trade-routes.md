# Newsletters and Alternative Trade Routes

Newsletters are booming.

Rebirth of blogs and RSS, long-form, high-quality content on open standards

Supply: Substack and Revue (new WordPress)
Demand: Stoop (new Google Reader) -> note: nto a fan of this one

Important feature: subscriptions.

> While blogs have never really figured out monetization (apart from ads), Substack alone claims more than 50,000 paying subscribers.

note: exception: Medium, paywalled news sites. But those are actually platform-centered subscriptions, Substack is by creator

Why?

- timing? (back in the blog era readers were not used to paying for digital content)
- format? (have to wait for newsletters to be received in inbox, like an Amazon package, feels more tangible?)
- more intimate relationship? Julian thinks blogs are more intimate. Newsletters are personal messages, blogs are personal homes (and also have unique design/format (note: sometimes)). note: not sure about this, something about newsletters (impermanence?) has an effect where newsletter content tends to be more intimate than what goes on the blog.

Newsletters seem less discoverable, more isolated (note: and therefore more personal?). Blogs reference other blogs.

### Alternative trade routes

> So what then explains the newsletter hype?
> Simple: Distribution.
>
> Every medium is essentially a two-sided market that needs to solve a chicken-and-egg-problem in order to take off. You need content suppliers to attract consumers and vice-versa.

Blogs: content suppliers but lacks consumers (RSS would have helped but never adopted on a large scale)
Social networks: victim of its success. Many consumers and therefore many creators... but it became crowded

> As other distribution channels are becoming increasingly crowded, email provides an alternative trade route.

Newsletters will eventually suffer from the same effect and become crowded.

> Just wait until Gmail introduces an algorithmic feed for your newsletter inbox.

### Alternative alternative trade routes

Recent trend: Telegram blogs.

More intimate: between messages from friends.

Can see entire history in a thread (less ephemeral than newsletters), and have discussion and community features built-in

note: just sharing links for now, more like with friends interested in a certain topic.

> I wonder if theyâ€™ll evolve into a unique Telegram blog format over time.

note: I doubt it
